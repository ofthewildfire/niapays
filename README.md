# NiaPays - OctoberCMS Donation Plugin

This plugin allows you to quickly set up a donation form and integrate Stripe payments on your OctoberCMS website. üëç

## Features

- Clean, Bootstrap-styled donation form
- Stripe payments integration (just add your key)
- Drag-and-drop component for easy use

## Requirements

- OctoberCMS version 3.x or higher
- Stripe API keys (added in backend settings)

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository into your `plugins` directory.
2. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   php artisan october:migrate
   ```

## Usage

1. After installation, go to **NiaPays Settings** in the backend and add your Stripe keys.
2. Choose a redirect page for successful donations.

### Configuration

Make sure to include the following in your CMS page or layout to ensure the form works properly:
```
{% framework extras %}
```
If you experience issues, this is often the cause.

You will also need JQuery to load BEFORE the component, or else the PaymentIntent will fail. 

The component you will need to add is below. 

```
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
{% framework extras %}
{% component 'donationForm' %}
```

## Backend

The backend provides a simple table to view successful donations.
